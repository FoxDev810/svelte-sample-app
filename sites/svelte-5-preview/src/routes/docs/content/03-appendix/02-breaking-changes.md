title: Breaking changes
---

While Svelte 5 is a complete rewrite, we have done our best to ensure that most codebases can upgrade with a minimum of hassle. That said, there are a few small breaking changes which may require action on your part. They are listed here.

## Components are no longer classes

In Svelte 3 and 4, components are classes. In Svelte 5 they are functions and should be instantiated differently. If you need to manually instantiate components, you should use `mount` or `createRoot` (imported from `svelte`) instead. If you see this error using SvelteKit, try updating to the latest version of SvelteKit first, which adds support for Svelte 5. If you're using Svelte without SvelteKit, you'll likely have a `main.js` file (or similar) which you need to adjust:

```diff
+ import { mount } from 'svelte';
import App from './App.svelte'

- const app = new App({ target: document.getElementById("app") });
+ const app = mount(App, { target: document.getElementById("app") });

export default app;
```

As a stop-gap-solution, you can also use `createClassComponent` or `asClassComponent` (imported from `svelte/legacy`) instead to keep the same API after instantiating. If this component is not under your control, you can use the `legacy.componentApi` compiler option for auto-applied backwards compatibility (note that this adds a bit of overhead to each component).

Similarly, components no longer have a `render` method when compiled for server side rendering. Instead, pass the function to `render` from `svelte/server`:

```diff
+ import { render } from 'svelte/server';
import App from './App.svelte';

- const { html, head } = App.render({ message: 'hello' });
+ const { html, head } = render(App, { props: { message: 'hello' } });
```
