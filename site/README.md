## Running locally

Set up the project:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sveltejs/svelte.git
cd svelte/site
npm ci
npm run update
```

Start the server with `npm run dev`, and navigate to [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## Using a local copy of Svelte

By default, the REPL will fetch the most recent version of Svelte from https://unpkg.com/svelte. To use the local copy of the compiler and runtime from this repo, you can navigate to [localhost:3000/repl?version=local](http://localhost:3000/repl?version=local). To produce the proper browser-compatible UMD build, you will need to run `npm run build` with the `PUBLISH` environment variable set (to any non-empty string).

## REPL GitHub integration

In order for the REPL's GitHub integration to work properly when running locally, you will need to create a GitHub OAuth app. Set its authorization callback URL to `http://localhost:3000/auth/callback`, and in this project, create `site/.env` containing:

```
GITHUB_CLIENT_ID=[your app's client id]
GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET=[your app's client secret]
BASEURL=http://localhost:3000
```

## Translating the API docs

Anchors are automatically generated using headings in the documentation and by default (for the english language) they are latinised to make sure the URL is always conforming to RFC3986.

If we need to translate the API documentation to a language using unicode chars, we can setup this app to export the correct anchors by setting up `SLUG_PRESERVE_UNICODE` to `true` and `SLUG_LANG` to the ISO 639-1 two-letter language code of your choice in `config.js`.
