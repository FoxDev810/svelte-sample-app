question: Are there any video courses?
---

Rich Harris, the creator of Svelte, taught a course:

- [Frontend Masters](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/svelte/)

There are also a couple of third-party courses:

- [Egghead](https://egghead.io/playlists/getting-started-with-svelte-3-05a8541a)
- [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/sveltejs-the-complete-guide/)

Note that Udemy very frequently has discounts over 90%.
