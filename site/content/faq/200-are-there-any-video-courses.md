question: Are there any video courses?
---

Rich Harris, the creator of Svelte, taught a course:

- [Frontend Masters](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/svelte/)

There are also a number of third-party courses:

- [Egghead](https://egghead.io/browse/frameworks/svelte)
- [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/courses/search/?q=sveltejs+svelte)

Note that Udemy very frequently has discounts over 90%.
