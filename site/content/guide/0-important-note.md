### Read the RFCs

Much of the documentation below is out of date! For more accurate and current information on how Svelte 3 works in the meantime, check out the RFCS on [reactive assignments](https://github.com/sveltejs/rfcs/blob/master/text/0001-reactive-assignments.md), [reactive stores](https://github.com/sveltejs/rfcs/blob/master/text/0002-reactive-stores.md) and [reactive declarations](https://github.com/sveltejs/rfcs/blob/master/text/0003-reactive-declarations.md).
