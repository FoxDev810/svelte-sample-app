This issue tracker is intended to collect bug reports and feature requests.

For help with installation, information on how features work, or questions about specific features of Svelte, please come and join us in the [Svelte Discord](https://svelte.dev/chat), or ask your question on [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/svelte).
