<!--
Thanks for raising an issue! To help us help you, if you've found a bug please consider the following:

* If you can demonstrate the bug using https://svelte.technology/repl, please do.
* If that's not possible, we recommend creating a small repo that illustrates the problem.
* Make sure you include information about the browser, and which version of Svelte you're using

Reproductions should be small, self-contained, correct examples – http://sscce.org.

Occasionally, this won't be possible, and that's fine – we still appreciate you raising the issue. But please understand that Svelte is run by unpaid volunteers in their free time, and issues that follow these instructions will get fixed faster.

If you have a stack trace to include, we recommend putting inside a `<details>` block for the sake of the thread's readability:
