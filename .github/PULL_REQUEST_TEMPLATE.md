<!--
Thank you for creating a pull request. Before submitting, please note the following:

* If your pull request implements a new feature, please raise an issue to discuss it before sending code. In many cases features are absent for a reason.
* This message body should clearly illustrate what problems it solves. If there are related issues, remember to reference them.
* Ideally, include a test that fails without this PR but passes with it. PRs will only be merged once they pass CI. (Remember to `npm run lint`!)
